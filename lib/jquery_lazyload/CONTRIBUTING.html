For example you have fixed a bug. You also have optimized some code. Optimization is not related to a bug. These should be submitted as separate pull requests. This way I can easily choose what to include. It is also easier to understand the code changes. Commit messages should be descriptive and full sentences.</p><p>Do not commit minified versions. Do not touch the version number.

It starts with capital letter but does not end with period. Headlines do not end with period. The GitHub default <code>Update filename.js</code> is not enough. When needed include also longer explanation what the commit does.</p><pre><code>Capitalized%2C%20short%20%2850%20chars%20or%20less%29%20summary%0A%0AMore%20detailed%20explanatory%20text%2C%20if%20necessary.%20%20Wrap%20it%20to%20about%2072%0Acharacters%20or%20so.%20%20In%20some%20contexts%2C%20the%20first%20line%20is%20treated%20as%20the%0Asubject%20of%20an%20email%20and%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20text%20as%20the%20body.%20%20The%20blank%0Aline%20separating%20the%20summary%20from%20the%20body%20is%20critical%20%28unless%20you%20omit%0Athe%20body%20entirely%29%3B%20tools%20like%20rebase%20can%20get%20confused%20if%20you%20run%20the%0Atwo%20together.
